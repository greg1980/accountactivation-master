          At the Annual General Conference of the Nigerian Bar Association held in Enugu in 2003, two sections of the Association
          were created, pursuant to a resolution of that Conference. These sections are Section on Business laws (SBL) and Section
          on Legal practice (SLP). The Council of each of these sections was appointed at the National Executive Committee meeting
          held in Ilorin, Kwara State in July 2004. In accordance with Article 2 of the Section Bye laws, any member of the
          Nigerian Bar Association shall be eligible for membership of either of the two sections, upon payment of the section dues
          for the current year to the Section Treasurer. He or she shall then be enrolled as a member of the section.
